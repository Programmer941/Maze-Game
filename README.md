# Maze-Game
I started by following this tutorial which was bit more up to date for setting up vr.

From there I downloaded all the needed packages to align objects to a grid.
I used the provided office asset pack to make a main area and then to make the maze floor and walls.
I implemented the movment I found in the previously mentioned video.
Then I made a few interactions including; opening the door with a button, changing the color of a monitor, and detecting when you bring the coffe to the end of the maze.
